# About
## About Me
I'm Mingxuan Zhang(张明轩), currently an undergraduate of Nanjing University. I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science. 
I'm interested in building up and maintaining my own systems. The system here can be an aquarium, an online judge server, or simply a course project...

## Origin of the BlogSite
In the process of taking courses, doing experiments and maintaining server, I've accumulated lots of markdown files as log / memo. They are fragmented and disorganized, yet contain some valuable knowledge gained from practice. This BlogSite is created to put this files in order. Also, I'm interested in setting and testing fonts and web styles, and this site can be a perfect playground.
